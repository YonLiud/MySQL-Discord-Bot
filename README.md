The bot 

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The Bot first connect to the database by reading the variables in ``vars.py`` and execute a connection query.

After that the bot will be listening to commands starting with the query, on command syntax it will run a check, if the user executing the query is whitelisted in the ``vars.py`` file, if the person is authorized, the query will be executed

If not, the query will not be executed and the bot will send an error message to the same channel of execution of command

The entire bot is written in Python 3.8
